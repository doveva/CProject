# CProject
Attempts to build a neural net to predict daily electricity load in a particular region
To run the neural net, you firstly need to run Data.py, which will download hourly load data. As an alternative you can unpack Data Load.rar to Data load folder
Then you can run Data transformer and with that you can calculate the output model
As a result you will have 2 graphs. 1 is for errors, the 2-nd one is for prediction/fact
